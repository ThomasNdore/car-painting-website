# Hello Guys



#👋 Hey there, I'm Thomas Kiti!

#🎓 Bachelor's in Computer Science | 🖥️ Coding Enthusiast | 🎤 Singer | 🥾 Hiker | 🚗 Driver | 🏍️ Rider

#👨‍💻 I'm passionate about all things code – turning ideas into functional software. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you might find me singing #my heart out or exploring nature through hiking. I also have a need for speed, whether it's on the road driving or enjoying the thrill of riding.

#🌐 Feel free to explore my repositories for tech projects, maybe a few tunes, and perhaps some captured moments from my outdoor adventures. Let's #connect and collaborate!
